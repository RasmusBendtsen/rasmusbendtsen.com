    <h3>What</h3>
CloudTodo is a simple todo app synchronising data instantly between devices. All data is securely stored in the cloud and you need to log in to get access.
    <br>
<h3>Why</h3>
    The initiatives for building the app was curriosity about AngularJS, the Javascript framework combined with a frustration of not finding any app among the (excessive amounts) of todo apps available, corresponding with my needs.<br><br>
So I decided to make my own.<br><br> 
</p>   
    <h3>Features</h3>
    The app is simple but have a range of features incl: 
    <ul>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Details</li>
        <li>Mark tasks done/ undone as the day progress and let done taksks stay in the app so you can keep track of what you have done</li>
        <li>Delete redundant/irrelevant tasks to keep your list tidy</li>
        <li>Colorcoded background color based on urgency level gives great over view</li>
        <li>Administrate your urgency levels, create new levels with title and background color and delete them again</li>
        <li>Edit task title, description and urgency level - as the tasks change over time.
        <li>Drag and drop support makes it easy to reorder your tasks</li>
        <li>Animated background with panoramic videos</li>
    </ul></br>
