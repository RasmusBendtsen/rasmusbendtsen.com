    <p>PROTOTYPE :: A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY</p>
    <p>The ordinary internal combustion engine is a key element in the urban soundscape.
        <br> Electric vehicles present a unique opportunity to influence and / or reduce the aural discomfort the traffic noise produces especially in urban environments. But silence is not a preferred alternative as the quiet electric engine represent a danger in the urban traffic. So
        <br> Most people use the engines sounds as a warning signal, a strong navigational tool to avoid getting hit by a car, but the absence of this sound from electric vehicles signal represents a potential danger. </p>
    <p>The sound from the ordinary internal combustion engine is basically mechanical, and mechanical noise is the sound foundation from which designers and engineers tuner sound in a desired direction. The noise from an internal combustion engine is, after this tuning-remain up to a certain degree mechanical, complex, atonal and with polyrhythmic qualities.
        <br> These sound quality characteristics are indeed different from the typical harmonic classical composition, where tonality, polyphony and rhythm are carefully researched by assistant principles that make music harmonious and melodious. </p>

    <p>PROTOTYPE :: THE IDEA BEHIND AND OUR QUESTIONS</p>
    <p>We have asked the question:
        <br> Is it possible to organize Car audio like music, so as to simulate the engine's aural expressions so clearly it is possible for pedestrians to localize and recognize it as an engine sound? And is it possible to maintain a single thread in car terms so that each car's connection to the total traffic sound gets metaphorical character of an instrument's role in the construction of a musical composition?</p>
    <p>We have in our design chosen to construct the sound design of the electric vehicle from such musical and compositional principles of rhythm, harmony, orchestration, form and so on. As a symphony orchestra with his instrumental diversity are organized in a symphony, ordered by a score, we want to transfer this metaphor to the city's sound environment. As a composer composes notation and organize instruments and sheet music, we will design a generative audio system through a metaphorical translation of notation, adaptively organizes and generates the sound of the cars and the city. We will open the perspectives of urban traffic noise, and ask questions at the rigid conception of the necessity of engine mechanical noise sound. We ask the question by making the city sound like a symphony, where each car with its voice and its functional expression is part of a musical aural whole, which creates the cars together.</p>

    <p>PROTOTYBE :: THE PROTOTYPE</p>
    <p>To present this idea and to make it possible to communicate it, we have made a 3D world, where the user can walk around and experience our idea on his own. The environment in the world is an urban area, surrounded by nature. </p>
    <p>The prototype is build in Unity3D and is controlled as a typical FPS game, so you can walk and jump around in the city and listen to the sound of the vehicles and get an impression of how EV traffic could impact on our urban environments. </p>
    <p>The user starts in the nature and is led along a highway to the city center. As the cars on the highway drives with high speed the natural noise produces by tires and wind noise is making the artificial noise unnecessary. In the city center you hear the sound design clearly. </p>
