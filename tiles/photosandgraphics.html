Most of these pictures are taken with my old analogue Nikon F75. An amazing camera that yet has to be beaten in quality and depth. I love that Camera. Lately my Canon d600 has had some good shots, a few of wich are in this collection. <br>

    Please enjoy the pictures, and if you fancy using any of the, please let me know  - just because it would make me proud and happy!<br>
    <br>Thank you!
