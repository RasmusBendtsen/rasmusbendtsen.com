<p>Sophie’s dreamleap is a game derived from the children’s game “the ground is poisonous”.
<br> Focus has been to make jumping the main focus, staying true to the real life game.
<br> In the world you play as Sophie, she is bored looking around in her home.
<br> She starts playing on the furniture, suddenly she releases she is in a game, her game;
<br> “the ground is poisonous”. She has her brother Oliver to help guide her through.
<br> Oliver has just deceased and they are playing through their previous experiences together.</p>
<p>The game consists of three levels, the first one introduces game.
<br> In the second room; Real-life you start to understand that your surroundings and the
<br> way you interact with them is the main mechanic of the game. The brother keeps in front,
<br> and is letting the player know that they are not alone. In the third level; Darkness things
<br> get strange with bigger furniture, darker background music and teddy bears coming to life.</p>
